## SoundCloud PHP Downloader

A simple PHP script that lets you download all the songs favorited by an artist. Simply copy the .env.example and add in your own CLIENT_ID (by creating an app on SoundCloud) and finding the artist ID for which you'd like to fetch all favorites from. Run `composer install`, and then invoke the command by running `./soundcloud-php`. The songs should show up in the `downloads` folder. This script does not handle playlists, and probably has a number of other issues.

Use at your own risk.
